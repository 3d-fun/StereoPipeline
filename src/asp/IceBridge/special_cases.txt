1. For GR_04222010, raw images are split into two dirs:

https://n5eil01u.ecs.nsidc.org/ICEBRIDGE_FTP/IODMS0_DMSraw_v01/2010_GR_NASA/04222010a_raw/
https://n5eil01u.ecs.nsidc.org/ICEBRIDGE_FTP/IODMS0_DMSraw_v01/2010_GR_NASA/04222010b_raw/

but the ortho images and lidar are in one dir:

https://n5eil01u.ecs.nsidc.org/ICEBRIDGE/IODMS1B.001/2010.04.22/
https://n5eil01u.ecs.nsidc.org/ICEBRIDGE/ILVIS2.001/2010.04.22/

The raw images need copying to the single directory for the other
datasets, and their index files need to be concatenated there.

2. For flight AN 20091026, the raw image folder 

https://n5eil01u.ecs.nsidc.org/ICEBRIDGE_FTP/IODMS0_DMSraw_v01/2009_AN_NASA/10252009_raw/

has images for both 10/25 and for 10/26. The ortho images though are split into two:

https://n5eil01u.ecs.nsidc.org/ICEBRIDGE/IODMS1B.001/2009.10.25/
https://n5eil01u.ecs.nsidc.org/ICEBRIDGE/IODMS1B.001/2009.10.26/

There is only one LIDAR file:

https://n5eil01u.ecs.nsidc.org/ICEBRIDGE/ILVIS2.001/2009.10.25/

For processing, it will be convenient to move data to a single
directory, for the earliest of these two dates, and concatenate the
orthoimage indicies from both directories, and the same for the raw
image index and DEM index files (the latter are empty in this case).

When it comes to submitting the data for archival, it perhaps makes
most sense to follow the same convention as for orthoimages (so
splitting things back), and need to verify the convention used in the
Fireball DEMs.

Here is the complete list of flights containing orthoimages but no raw
images, and which need to be appended instead to previous day's flight
for processing.
