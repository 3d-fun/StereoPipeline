Here we describe how CCD artifacts in WorldView imagery are are
tabulated and then corrected.

Basic idea
----------

For each TDI/scan direction perform several runs.  For each run,
average all rows of the disparity (ignore invalid disparities).
Average these over multiple runs.  We get n Vector2 values (since each
valid disparity pixel is a Vector2), where n is the image width. From
these, we will extract the locations of CCD jumps and their values in
x and in y. Those will be hard-coded in asp/Tools/wv_correct.cc.

Detailed instructions
---------------------

1. Run
  stereo --part-of-multiview-run --alignment-method homography \ 
  --subpixel-mode 1 --corr-max-levels 2 --disable-fill-holes   \
  --left-image-crop-win 0 starty widx widy                     \
  left.tif right.tif left.xml right.xml run/run

Do a second run with left and right images flipped, to get more data.

Potentially use

  --corr-seed-mode 3
  
All these options are essential. We need

  --part-of-multiview-run --alignment-method homography  

to keep one-to-one correspondence between input image pixels and
final disparity pixels. This also why images must not be map-projected.

The value --subpixel-mode 1 is mainly for speed.  The value
--corr-max-levels 2 is to handle images without large scale features
(that's why --corr-seed-mode 3 may also be helpful).

Of course we don't want to fill in holes to not pollute the
disparities. We really want to look at a portion of the disparities
that has as many valid and non-noisy pixels as possible, that's why we
use

 --left-image-crop-win 0 starty widx widy

The value widx should be the maximum image width. The values
starty and widy can be chosen to ensure each row in the disparity is
of high quality.

2. Inspect the F.tif disparity. Crop away some top and bottom rows
if they are incomplete or have noise. Average the obtained rows using
asp/WVCorrect/disp_avg.cc.
   


%How to deal with CCD artifacts:
%
%1. Find the average disparity for a given run
%   g=a100  # this a directory having input images and xml files                    
%   qsub -N $g -l select=1:ncpus=8 -l walltime=15:00:00 -W group_list=s1219 \
%   -j oe -m n -- $(pwd)/driver.sh $(pwd)/$g                          
%
%   The average disparities will go to dx.txt and dy.txt in some subdirectories.

addpath(genpath('/home/oalexan1/projects/StereoPipeline/src/asp/WVCorrect'))

do_find=0;
pitches=[8.000000000000000e-03]
dirs={'WV02_14DEC081'};

find_ccds(do_find, dirs, pitches)

%
%2. Plot the average disparities for a set of runs with given TDI and
%   scan direction using plot_ccds.m.  Manually throw away the noisy
%   ones. At the end, the CCD jumps in x and in y will be saved to
%   text files. The auxiliary tools gen_scandir.m and plot_ccds.m
%   can help with plotting.
%
%3. Hard-code the obtained values in wv_correct.cc.
