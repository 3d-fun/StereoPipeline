*** RELEASE 2.0.0, 20 JUNE 2012 ***

GENERAL

   dependencies.

SESSIONS
 - Enabled parallel writing in Pinhole Session.

TOOLS
 - Fix possible infinite loop in stereo_corr's search range.
 - Shutoff rotation invariance in automatic search range for better
   quality results. This is possible because the input images are
   already aligned.
 - Sub image produced by stereo_pprc are now limited to around 8MB.
 - Fix disparity_debug to work with integer disparities as well.
 - All ASP tools should now have a '--version' option.
 - Bug fix point2dem where rasterizer was accessing outside of
   allocated memory.

SESSIONS
 - Added support for CAHVORE in pinhole sessions.

TOOLS
 - Hide GDAL warnings caused by our file integrity checks.
 - Mostly added standardized options for settings threads and BigTIFF.
 - Have orthoproject return same type as input plus alpha channel.
 - Improved edge_masking, speeds up stereo_fltr and stereo_pprc.
 - Have cam2map4stereo.py explictly use ISIS's getkey command.
 - Fix and optimized point2dem. Remove caching and improved rendering
   times. This should fix BigTIFF problems that have been reported.
 - Improve triangulation times slightly when using map projected
   linescan camers.

EXAMPLES
 - Added orthoproject, image2qtree, colormap, hillshade examples to MOC.
 - Added K10 example dataset.

*** RELEASE 1.0.3.1, 16 MARCH 2011 ***

GENERAL
 - Updated documentation and support text files to insure compatibility
   with our third party software.

*** RELEASE 1.0.3, 11 MARCH 2011 ***

ISISIO
 - Make quaternion interaction compliant with VW changes.

SESSIONS
 - Correct reading of TSAI camera format.

TOOLS
 - Reduce memory footprint of ISIS_Adjust.
 - MOC Example rewritten.
 - Improve dash script that loads libraries on startup of application.

VISION WORKBENCH benefits
 - KD-Tree search replace with FLANN, a fast approximate nearest
   neighbors. This improves speed of ipmatch, and ip alignment
   option in stereo.
 - Removed exception catch in Bayesian affine sub-pixel.
 - Fixed type deduction problem on 32 bit systems.
 - Pyramid Correlator code cleaned up. Minimal speed improvement.

   This problem is non-existant in RHEL5 and is still a mystery.

*** RELEASE 1.0.2, 9 DECEMBER 2010 ***

ISISIO
 - IsisCameraModel support operator<< style printing.
 - Correct camera pose return to be consistent with VW.

TOOLS
 - Executables should catch VW and Standard errors and print human readable
   responses.
 - Stereo is now a python script that call multiple executables.
 - Change correlation progress bar to track total completion.
 - Bundle_Adjust and ISIS_Adjust switch from eulers to quaternions.
 - Bundlevis dropped CAHVOR support. Added progress bar. Converted statistics
   with CDFAccumulator.
 - Point2dem remove excessive rotation call
 - Enforce tile rasterization size to 1024 during integer correlation.
 - Select tools should now write their nodata value in the TIFF metadata.

PHOTOMETRYTK

*** RELEASE 1.0.1, 24 MAY 2010 ***

CORE
 - Control Network Loader removed and sent to VW's Bundle Adjustment Module.
 - Build system can now use Google PerfTools.
 - Kakadu was made optional in build system (ISIS 3.2.x uses this).

ISISIO
 - Optimized IsisCameraModel to use IsisInterface. Custom code can be loaded up
   for individual camera types so we don't have to run through ISIS's entire
   camera model. This allows us not to call GroundMap when the camera is not
   map projected.
 - Added a series of tests for the IsisCameraModel that perform unit tests
   with MOC and Galileo.
 - Added custom project code for Linescan cameras so not to rely on ISIS's
   LineScanCameraGroundMap. This code is a bit more precise.

MPI
 - Added new optional module called MPI that builds on top of
   Boost MPI. This is experimental development code and is not used for
   anything in binary release yet.

PHOTOMETRYTK
 - Added new optional module call the Photometry Toolkit. This is
   experimental development code and is not use for anything released
   in the binary yet. This code focuses on future research of massive
   mosaics (+100GB) and the ability to perform basic photometric corrections.

SESSIONS
 - Pinhole session modified to read CMOD files as well.

SPICEIO

TOOLS
 - Made orthoproject more robust against odd input georeferences.
 - orthoproject's auto scale and crop works again.
 - Point2mesh's texture is written to a different file.
 - Added aligndem and geodiff, experimental DEM alignment utilities.
 - Added a quick experimental DEM profile utility called dem_profile.
 - stereo now detects correlation settings automatically using OBALoG and
   SGrad1 interest point functions.
 - Added cam2map4stereo.py
 - Remove excessive serial number calculations in isis_adjust.
 - Update isis_adjust to VW's new Bundle Adjustment module for a 2x improvement.
 - Stereo should now use LZW compression by default.
 - Point2dem and Stereo have added option to use directory other than /tmp for
   intermediate files.
 - Point2dem now uses MOLA datum instead of its previous truncated value.
 - Added safety check to stereo to make sure user is not supplying the
   same camera.
 - Added point2las, a utility for converting a point cloud to the LAS format.

 - Switched from CXXTests to GTest framework.
