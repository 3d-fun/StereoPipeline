*** RELEASE 1.0.2, 9 DECEMBER 2010 ***

ISISIO
 - IsisCameraModel support operator<< style printing.
 - Correct camera pose return to be consistent with VW.
 - Change IsisCameraModel to use shared_ptr to block memory leak.

TOOLS
 - Executables should catch VW and Standard errors and print human readable
   responses.
 - Stereo is now a python script that call multiple executables.
 - Change correlation progress bar to track total completion.
 - Bundle_Adjust and ISIS_Adjust switch from eulers to quaternions.
 - Bundlevis dropped CAHVOR support. Added progress bar. Converted statistics
   with CDFAccumulator.
 - Point2dem remove excessive rotation call
 - Enforce tile rasterization size to 1024 during integer correlation.
 - Select tools should now write their nodata value in the TIFF metadata.

PHOTOMETRYTK
 - Still unreleased, and still under development.

*** RELEASE 1.0.1, 24 MAY 2010 ***

CORE
 - Control Network Loader removed and sent to VW's Bundle Adjustment Module.
 - Build system can now use Google PerfTools.
 - Kakadu was made optional in build system (ISIS 3.2.x uses this).

ISISIO
 - Optimized IsisCameraModel to use IsisInterface. Custom code can be loaded up
   for individual camera types so we don't have to run through ISIS's entire
   camera model. This allows us not to call GroundMap when the camera is not
   map projected.
 - Added a series of tests for the IsisCameraModel that perform unit tests
   with MOC and Galileo.
 - Added custom project code for Linescan cameras so not to rely on ISIS's
   LineScanCameraGroundMap. This code is a bit more precise.

MPI
 - Added new optional module called MPI that builds on top of
   Boost MPI. This is experimental development code and is not used for
   anything in binary release yet.

PHOTOMETRYTK
 - Added new optional module call the Photometry Toolkit. This is
   experimental development code and is not use for anything released
   in the binary yet. This code focuses on future research of massive
   mosaics (+100GB) and the ability to perform basic photometric corrections.

SESSIONS
 - Pinhole session modified to read CMOD files as well.

SPICEIO

TOOLS
 - Made orthoproject more robust against odd input georeferences.
 - orthoproject's auto scale and crop works again.
 - Point2mesh's texture is written to a different file.
 - Added aligndem and geodiff; which are experimental DEM alignment utilities.
 - Added a quick experimental DEM profile utility called dem_profile.
 - stereo now detects correlation settings automatically using OBALoG and
   SGrad1 interest point functions.
 - Added cam2map4stereo.py
 - Remove excessive serial number calculations in isis_adjust.
 - Update isis_adjust to VW's new Bundle Adjustment module for a 2x improvement.
 - Stereo should now use LZW compression by default.
 - Point2dem and Stereo have added option to use directory other than /tmp for
   intermediate files.
 - Point2dem now uses MOLA datum instead of its previous truncated value.
 - Added safety check to stereo to make sure user is not supplying the
   same camera.

TESTS
 - Switched from CXXTests to GTest framework.

*** RELEASE 1.0.0, 23 OCTOBER ***

CORE
 - OrthoRasterizer.h is subject to change for further VW integration
 - MedianFilter.h is untested/unused
 - BundleAdjustUtils.* is subject to deletion for integration with
   ControlNetworkLoader.*

ISISIO

SESSIONS
 - ISIS Session is the only fully supported session at this time
 - Pinhole Session works but has not been tested for this release
 - Keypoint/RMAX Session status are unknown

SPICEIO
 - Subject to deletion in 1.0.1

TOOLS
 - Point2dem can crash rarely. Still investigating.
 - rmax* utilities are not working
