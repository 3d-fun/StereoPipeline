\chapter{The {\tt stereo.default} File}
\label{ch:stereodefault}

The \texttt{stereo.default} file contains configuration parameters
that the \texttt{stereo} program uses to process images.  The
\texttt{stereo.default} file is loaded from the current working
directory when you run \texttt{stereo} unless you specify a different
file using the \texttt{-s} option. Run \texttt{stereo -\/-help} for
more information. The extension is not important for this file.

Below we will walk through the contents of the \texttt{stereo.default}
and discuss its various parameters.  If you want to start with a clean
slate, you can copy the \texttt{stereo.default.example} file that is
included in the top level of the Stereo Pipeline software distribution.

Note: The parameters that begin with `\texttt{DO\_*}' are true/false
options, when set to `1' they are `on' or `true,' and if set to `0'
they are `off' or `false.'  All parameters below have their default
values listed after the parameter name.

\section{Preprocessing}
\hrule
\bigskip

\begin{description}
\item[CACHE\_DIR \textnormal (default = /tmp)] \hfill \\
  Place for to store intermediate files for when Stereo Pipeline can't
  store entire image in memory. User should change directory if
  operating system has limit on filesize inside the \texttt{/tmp}
  directory.

\item[ALIGNMENT\_METHOD \textnormal (default = NONE)] \hfill \\
  When \texttt{ALIGNMENT\_METHOD} is set to \texttt{HOMOGRAPHY},
  \texttt{stereo} will attempt to pre-align the images by
  automatically detecting tie-points between images using a feature
  based image matching technique. Tiepoints are stored in a
  \texttt{*.match} file that is used to compute a linear homography
  transformation of the right image so that it closely matches the
  left image.  Note: the user may exercise more control over this
  process by using the \texttt{ipfind} and \texttt{ipmatch} tools.

  When \texttt{ALIGNMENT\_METHOD} is set to \texttt{EPIPOLAR},
  \texttt{stereo} will apply a 3D transform to both images so that
  their epipolar lines will be horizontal. This speeds of stereo
  correlation as it greatly reduces the area required for searching.

  {\em Epipolar alignment is only available when performing stereo
    matches using the pinhole stereo session (i.e. when using}
  \texttt{stereo -t pinhole}){\em, and cannot be used when processing
    ISIS images at this time.}

\item[FORCE\_USE\_ENTIRE\_RANGE \textnormal{\small{(= 0,1)}} (default = 0)] \hfill \\
  By default, the Stereo Pipeline will normalize ISIS images so that
  their maximum and minimum channel values are $\pm$2 standard
  deviations from a mean value of 1.0.  Use this option if you want to
  {\em disable} normalization in the stereo pipeline and force the raw
  values to pass directly to the stereo correlations algorithms.

  For example, if ISIS's \texttt{histeq} has already been used to
  normalize the images, then use this option to disable normalization
  as a (redundant) pre-processing step.


\item[DO\_INDIVIDUAL\_NORMALIZATION \textnormal (default = 0)] \hfill \\
  By default, the maximum and minimum valid pixel value is determined
  by looking at both images.  Normalized with the same ``global'' min
  and max guarantees that the two images will retain their brightness
  and contrast relative to each other.

  This option forces each image to be normalized to its own maximum
  and minimum valid pixel value. This is useful in the event that
  images have different and non-overlapping dynamic ranges. You can
  sometimes tell when this option is needed: after a failed stereo
  attempt one of the rectified images (\texttt{*-L.tif} and
  \texttt{*-R.tif}) may be either mostly white or black.  Activating
  this option may correct this problem.

  Note: Photometric calibration and image normalization are steps that
  can and should be carried out beforehand using ISIS's own utilities.
  This provides the best possible input to the stereo pipeline and
  yields the best stereo matching results.

\item[PREPROCESSING\_FILTER\_MODE \textnormal{\small{(= 0,1,2,3)}} (default = 3)] \hfill \\
  This selects the pre-processing filter to be used to prepare imagery
  before it is fed to the initialization stage of the pipeline.

  \begin{description}
    \item[0 - None]
    \item[1 - Subtracted Mean] - This takes a preferrably large
      gaussian kernel and subtracts its value from the input
      image. This effectively reduces low frequency content in the
      image. The result is correlation that is immune to translations
      in image intensity.
    \item[2 - LoG Filter] - Takes the Laplacian of Gaussian of the
      image, This provides some immunity to differences in lighting
      conditions between a pair of images by isolating and matching on
      blob features in the image.
  \end{description}

  For modes 1 and 2 above, the size of the filter kernel is
  determined by the SLOG\_KERNEL\_WIDTH variable below.

  The choice of pre-processing filter must be made with thought to the
  cost function being used (see COST\_MODE, below).  LoG filter
  preprocessing provides good immunity to variations in lighting
  conditions and is usually the recommended choice.

\item[SLOG\_KERNEL\_WIDTH \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{float})}} (default = 1.4)] \hfill \\
  This defines the diameter of the Gaussian convolution kernel used
  for the preprocessing modes 1 and 2 above. A value of 1.4 works
  well for LoG and 25 works well for Subtracted Mean.

\section{Correlation}
\hrule
\bigskip

\begin{description}

\item[COST\_MODE \textnormal{\small{(= 0,1,2)}}] (default = 2) \hfill \\

  This defines the cost function used during integer
  correlation. Squared difference is the fastest cost
  function. However it comes at the price of not being resilient
  against noise. Absolute difference is the next fastest and is a
  better choice. Normalized cross correlation is the slowest but is
  designed to be more robust against image intensity changes and
  slight lighting differences. Normalized cross correlation is about
  2x slower than absolute difference and about 3x slower than squared
  difference.

  \begin{description}
    \item[0 - absolute difference]
    \item[1 - squared difference]
    \item[2 - normalized cross correlation]
  \end{description}

\item[H\_KERNEL \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{integer})}} (default = 25)]
\item[V\_KERNEL \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{integer})}} (default = 25)] \hfill \\
  These two items determine the size (in pixels) of the correlation
  kernel used in the initialization step.  A different size can be set
  in the horizontal \emph{(H)} and vertical \emph{(V)} directions, but
  square correlation kernels are almost always used in practice.

\item[H\_CORR\_MIN \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{integer})}}]
\item[H\_CORR\_MAX \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{integer})}}]
\item[V\_CORR\_MIN \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{integer})}}]
\item[V\_CORR\_MAX \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{integer})}}] \hfill \\
  These parameters determine the size of the initial correlation
  search range.  The ideal search range depends on a variety of
  factors ranging from how the images were pre-aligned to the
  resolution and range of disparities seen in a given image pair.
  This search range is successively refined during initialization, so
  it is often acceptable to set a large search range that is guaranteed
  to contain all of the disparities in a given image.  However,
  setting tighter bounds on the search can sometimes reduce the number
  of erroneous matches, so it can be advantageous to tune the
  search range for a particular data set.

  Commenting out these settings will cause \texttt{stereo} to make an
  attempt to guess its search range using interest points.

\item[SUBPIXEL\_MODE \textnormal{\small{(= 0,1,2,3)}} (default = 2)] \hfill \\
  This parameter selects the subpixel correlation method. These
  algorithms are arranged in order of decreasing speed and increasing
  quality. Parabola subpixel is very fast but will produce results
  that are only slightly more accurate than those produced by the
  initialization step. Bayes EM (mode 2) is very slow but offers the
  best quality. When tuning {\tt stereo.default} parameters, it is
  expedient to start out using parabola subpixel as a ``draft mode.''
  When the results are looking good with parabola subpixel, then they
  will look even better with subpixel mode 2.

  \begin{description}
    \item[0 - no subpixel refinement]
    \item[1 - parabola fitting ]
    \item[2 - affine adaptive window, Bayes EM weighting ]
    \item[3 - affine adaptive window, Bayes EM with Gamma Noise Distribution (experimental) ]
  \end{description}

  For a visual comparison of the quality of these subpixel modes,
  refer back to Chapter:\ref{ch:correlation}.

\item[SUBPIXEL\_H\_KERNEL \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{integer})}} (default = 35)]
\item[SUBPIXEL\_V\_KERNEL \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{integer})}} (default = 35)] \hfill \\
  Specify the size of the horizontal \emph{(H)} and vertical
  \emph{(V)} size (in pixels) of the subpixel correlation kernel.

\end{description}

\section{Filtering}
\hrule
\bigskip

\begin{description}

\item[RM\_H\_HALF\_KERN \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{integer})}} (default = 5)]
\item[RM\_V\_HALF\_KERN \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{integer})}} (default = 5)] \hfill \\
  Taken together, the RM\_* settings adjust the behavior of an outlier
  rejection scheme that ``erodes'' isolated regions of pixels in the
  disparity map that are in disagreement with their neighbors.

  The RM\_H\_HALF\_KERN and RM\_V\_HALF\_KERN parameters determine the
  size of the half kernel that is used to perform the automatic
  removal of low confidence pixels.  A $5 \times 5$ half kernel
  would result in an $11 \times 11$ kernel with 121 pixels in it.

\item[RM\_MIN\_MATCHES \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{integer})}} (default = 60)] \hfill \\
  This parameter sets the {\em percentage} of neighboring disparity
  values that must fall within the inlier threshold in order for a
  given disparity value to be retained.

\item[RM\_THRESHOLD \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{integer})}} (default = 3)] \hfill \\
  This parameter sets the inlier threshold for the outlier rejection
  scheme.  This option works in conjunction with RM\_MIN\_MATCHES
  above.  A disparity value is rejected if it differs by more than
  RM\_THRESHOLD disparity values from RM\_MIN\_MATCHES percent of
  pixels in the region being considered.

\item[RM\_CLEANUP\_PASSES \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{integer})}} (default = 1)] \hfill \\
  Select the number of outlier removal passes that are carried out.
  Each pass will erode pixels that do not match their neighbors.  One
  pass is usually sufficient.

%\item[ERODE\_MAX\_SIZE \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{integer})}} (default = 1,000)] \hfill \\
%  Max island size in pixels that will removed post above filter. The
%  filter above removes high gradients and will leave spots behind that
%  belong to a mis-correlation. This process will attempt to identify
%  and remove them. \underline{Never set this value to zero as it will
%    remove everything.} This process can not be shut off but you can
%  set the value to 1 where it then removes single isolated pixels.
%
\item[FILL\_HOLES \textnormal{\small{(= 0,1)}} (default = 1)] \hfill \\
  When this option is on, the holes in the disparity map that result
  from poor stereo matching will be filled by an inpainting
  algorithm. Inpainting is a convolution method that takes the values
  at the edges of holes and spreads those values inward. This method
  performs best for small holes.

  Note: you can always use the good pixel mask image ({\tt
    *-GoodPixelMap.TIF}) to determine which pixels represent ``real''
  data matched by the stereo correlator, and which pixels represent
  interpolated data produced by inpainting.

\item[FILL\_HOLE\_MAX\_SIZE \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{integer})}} (default = 100,000)] \hfill \\
  This defines the maximum size of a hole that the inpainting
  technique should attempt. Default is 100,000 pixels.

\end{description}

\section{Post-Processing}
\hrule
\bigskip

\begin{description}
\item[NEAR\_UNIVERSE\_RADIUS \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{float})}} (default = 0.0)]
\item[FAR\_UNIVERSE\_RADIUS \textnormal{\small{(= \emph{float})}} (default = 0.0)] \hfill \\
  These parameters can be used to filter out triangulated points in
  the 3D point cloud by setting an near and far radius value from
  origin of the point cloud's coordinate system, [0,0,0].  For most
  ISIS cameras, the origin is the center of the body (e.g. the Moon or
  Mars), and is part of a body-fixed Cartesian coordinate system that
  rotates with the planet.

  These settings are most useful for other stereo session types
  (e.g. pinhole), where the origin of the coordinate system is often
  one of the cameras in a stereo pair.  In this case, these parameters
  can be used to reject pixels that are too close or too far from the
  camera system.

  Setting both values zero turns off this restriction and allows the
  dot cloud to be as big as the data allows for.
