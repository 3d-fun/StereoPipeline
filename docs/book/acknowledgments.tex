This open source version of the \ac{ASP} was developed by the
\ac{IRG}, in the Intelligent Systems Division at the \ac{NASA} Ames
Research Center in Moffett Field, CA. It builds on over ten years
of IRG experience developing surface reconstruction tools for
terrestrial robotic field tests and planetary exploration. \\

A number of student interns have made significant contributions to
this project over the years: Sasha Aravkin (Washington State
University), Patrick
Mihelich (Stanford University), Melissa Bunte (Arizona State
University), Matthew Faulkner (Massachusetts Institute of Technology),
Todd Templeton (UC Berkeley), Morgon Kanter (Bard College), Kerri
Cahoy (Stanford University), and Ian Saxton (UC San Diego).

The open source Stereo Pipeline leverages stereo image processing
work, past and present, led by Dr. Laurence Edwards, Eric Zbinden
(formerly NASA/QSS Inc.), Dr.~Michael Sims (NASA), and others in the
Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames Research Center. It has
benefited substantially from the contributions of Dr.~Keith Nishihara
(formerly NASA/Stanford), Randy Sargent (NASA/Carnegie Mellon
University), Dr.~Judd Bowman (formerly NASA/QSS Inc.), Clay Kunz
(formerly NASA/QSS Inc.), and Dr.~Matthew Deans (NASA).

\section*{Acknowledgments}

The initial adaptation of Ames' stereo surface reconstruction tools to
orbital imagers was a result of a NASA funded, industry led project to
develop automated \ac{DEM} generation techniques for
the \ac{MGS} mission. Our work with that project's
Principle Investigator, Dr.~Michael Malin of Malin Space Science
Systems (MSSS), and Co-Investigator, Dr.~Laurence Edwards of NASA
Ames, inspired the idea of making stereo surface reconstruction
technology available and accessible to a broader community.  We thank
Dr.~Malin and Dr.~Edwards for providing the initial impetus that in no
small way made this open source stereo pipeline possible, and we thank
Dr.~Michael Caplinger, Joe Fahle and others at MSSS for their help and
technical assistance.

We'd also like to thank our friends and collaborators Dr.~Randolph
Kirk, Dr.~Brent Archinal, Trent Hare, and Mark Rosiek of the United
States Geological Survey's (USGS's) Astrogeology Science Center in
Flagstaff, AZ, for their encouragement and willingness to share
their experience and expertise by answering many of our technical
questions.  We also thank them for their ongoing support and efforts
to help us evaluate our work.  Thanks also to the USGS \ac{ISIS} team,
especially Jeff Anderson and Kris Becker, for their help in integrating
this version of the stereo pipeline with the USGS \ac{ISIS} software
package.

Thanks go also to Dr.~Mark Robinson, Jacob Danton, Ernest
Bowman-Cisneros, Dr.~Sam Laurence, and Melissa Bunte at Arizona State
University for their help in adapting the Ames' stereo pipeline to
lunar data sets including the Apollo Metric Camera.

Finally, we thank Melissa Bunte, Dr.~Ara Nefian, and Dr.~Laurence
Edwards for their contributions to this documentation, and Dr.~Terry
Fong (IRG Group Lead) for his management and support of the open
source and public software release process.
