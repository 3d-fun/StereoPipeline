@book{triggs00,
	Abstract = { This paper is a survey of the theory and methods of photogrammetric bundle adjustment, aimed at potential implementors in the computer vision community. Bundle adjustment is the problem of refining a visual reconstruction to produce jointly optimal structure and viewing parameter estimates. Topics covered include the choice of cost function and robustness numerical optimization including sparse Newton methods, linearly convergent approximations, updating and recursive methods gauge (datum) invariance and quality control. The theory is developed for general robust cost functions rather than restricting attention to traditional nonlinear least squares. </P> <P>Keywords: Bundle Adjustment, Scene Reconstruction, Gauge Freedom, Sparse Matrices, Optimization.},
