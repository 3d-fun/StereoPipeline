The Stereo Pipeline was developed within the Autonomous Systems and
Robotics area of the Inteligent Systems Division at the NASA Ames
Research Center.  It leverages the Intelligent Robotics Group's (IRG)
extensive experience developing surface reconstruction tools for
planetary exploration--e.g. the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration
Rover missions--and rover autonomy, and draws on the Adaptive Control
and Evolvable Systems (ACES) group's experience developing computer
vision techniques for autonomous vehicle control systems.

The initial adaptation of the stereo pipeline to orbital imagers was a
result of a NASA project led by Dr. Michael Malin of Malin Space
Science Systems (MSSS) working in collaboration with Dr. Laurence
Edwards of NASA Ames to develop automated Digital Elevation Model
generation techniques for the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission.

The lead developers of the Stereo Pipeline are Michael Broxton,
Matthew Hancher, and Dr. Laurence Edwards. See the AUTHORS file for a
complete list of developers.

Portions of this software were developed with support from the
following NASA funding sources: the Mars Technology Program, the Mars
Critical Data Products Initiative, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
mission, the Applied Information Systems Research program, and the
Lunar Mapping and Modeling Program.
