The Stereo Pipeline was developed within the Autonomous Systems and
Robotics area of the Inteligent Systems Division at NASA's Ames
Research Center.  It leverages the Intelligent Robotics Group's
(IRG) extensive experience developing surface reconstruction and
tools for planetary exploration--e.g. the Mars Pathfinder and Mars
Exploration Rover missions--and rover autonomy.  It has also been
developed in collaboration with the Adaptive Control and Evolvable
Systems (ACES) group, and draws on their experience developing
computer vision techniques for autonomous vehicle control systems.

The lead developers of the Stereo Pipeline are Michael Broxton,
Matthew Hancher, and Laurence Edwards.  See the AUTHORS file for a
complete list of developers.
