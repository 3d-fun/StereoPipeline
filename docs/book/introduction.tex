\section{Warnings for using the Ames Stereo Pipeline}

While we are confident that the algorithms used by this software
are robust, they have not been systematically tested or rigorously
compared to other methods in the peer-reviewed literature.  As such,
there is no guarantee that the topography produced by this software 
is any good.  You have been warned! \emph{MJB: fix this}
