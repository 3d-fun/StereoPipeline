\section{Warnings for using the Ames Stereo Pipeline}

This is an ALPHA release of the Stereo Pipeline.  There are many
known bugs and incomplete features, and the API will almost certainly
change prior to the final release.  Much of the documentation is
incomplete or incorrect.  Although we hope you will find this release
helpful, you use it at your own risk.

While we are confident that the algorithms used by this software
are robust, they have not been systematically tested or rigorously
compared to other methods in the peer-reviewed literature.  As such,
there is no guarantee that the topography produced by this software 
is any good.  You have been warned! \emph{MJB: fix this}
