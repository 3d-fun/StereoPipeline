This open source version of the Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP) was
developed by the Intelligent Robotics Group (IRG), in the Intelligent
Systems Division at NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, CA. It
builds on over ten years of IRG experience developing surface
reconstruction tools for terrestrial robotic field tests and planetary
exploration.

Credit and thanks go to the following developers for contributing time
and energy to this effort.
