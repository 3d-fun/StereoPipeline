INSTALLATION AND USE

A. Obtaining the Software

If you are reading this text, you presumably have a copy of the
software.  However, you can obtain the most recent version from
  https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline

B. Installing the Software

Stereo Pipeline pre-built binaries are available from two locations:

Official releases at:
  http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/intelligent-robotics/ngt/stereo/

Daily builds of the latest development version at:
  http://byss.arc.nasa.gov/stereopipeline/daily_build/

If desired, Stereo Pipeline can be built from source as well. Building
from source can be difficult, due to the large number of dependencies,
and the variety of Linux and Mac architectures Stereo Pipeline
supports. A separate software package called BinaryBuilder will take
care of setting up the build environment and building the code. We
describe below what dependencies BinaryBuilder needs and then how to
invoke it.

1. Base dependencies - LINUX

The following packages need to be installed in order to build Stereo
Pipeline:

g++
gfortran
libtool
autoconf
automake
ccache
git-core
subversion
xserver-xorg-dev
xorg-dev
libx11-dev
libgl1-mesa-dev
libglu1-mesa-dev
libglut3-dev

If you have root access on your machine you can install them using the
following command:

sudo apt-get install g++ gfortran libtool autoconf automake \
  ccache git-core subversion xserver-xorg-dev xorg-dev      \ 
  libx11-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libglut3-dev

You may need to manually install the following package:
ccache - http://samba.org/ftp/ccache/ccache-3.1.9.tar.bz2

2. Base dependencies - MAC

First install Macports (http://www.macports.org/) if you do not already have it.

Next you need the following packages:

libtool
git-core
subversion
xz

You may need to manually install the following package:
ccache - http://samba.org/ftp/ccache/ccache-3.1.9.tar.bz2

If you are using OSX 10.7 Lion, you will need to manually install the
OSX 10.5 SDK. This is required for building against ISIS since they
currently only have a 10.5 version of their binary.  See instructions
here: http://lunokhod.org/?p=269

Next you need to compile a copy of GNU Coreutils.  The following
instructions should do so:

cd ~/packages
wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.16.tar.xz
xz -d coreutils-8.16.tar.xz
tar xfv coreutils-8.16.tar
cd coreutils-8.16
./configure --prefix $PWD/build
make install -j 8

3. Invoking Binary Builder

Having installed the base libraries and tools, the following lines of
code will start the build of Stereo Pipeline in the directory
'~/projects/BinaryBuilder':

cd ~; mkdir projects; cd projects
git clone https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/BinaryBuilder.git
cd BinaryBuilder
./build.py

MAC USERS: The last line needs to specify the path to the coreutils
you installed earlier:
./build.py --coreutils ~/packages/coreutils-8.16/build/bin

Due to the amount of code that must be downloaded and built,
BinaryBuilder will take quite a while to finish.  If you see the
message "All done!" then it has succeeded.  Otherwise something has
gone wrong and must be fixed before the build can continue.  Often
this is due to one of the dependencies listed earlier being too old or
missing.

If the build failed and you need to restart it after finding a fix,
use the following command:

./build.py --resume


Once the build is successful you should make a distribution tarball to
store the completed build. Do so using the following command from the
BinaryBuilder directory:

./make-dist.py last-completed-run/install

C. Using the Software

When you unpack the Stereo Pipeline tarball, it will contain a copy of
the documentation in pdf format, a set of command-line tools in the
"bin/" directory, and other dependencies. The "bin/" directory needs
to be in your path. See the README file for how to use Stereo
Pipeline.
