INSTALLATION AND USE

A. Obtaining the Software

If you are reading this text then presumably you have a copy of
the software.  However, you can obtain the most recent version from

  http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/project/ngt

Before attempting to configure, build or install the NGT you should
obtain and install any prerequisite libraries that you need.  The only
absolute requirement is the Boost.  The others are either required to
build a specific module, or will enable a particular feature if
available.  A complete list of dependencies is shown in the table below,
where each library is noted as being either a required or optional
dependency of one or modules.  See each individual library's
documentation for details.

+------------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Library          | Required?   | Source Website                          |
+------------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Vision Workbench | Required    | http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/visionworkbench/ |
| Boost            | Required    | http://www.boost.org/                   |
| ISIS             | Recommended | http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/      |
| OpenSceneGraph   | Optional    | http://www.openscenegraph.org/          |

B. Building and Installing

Once you have obtained and installed all of the prerequisite software
the process of building the NGT itself is generally
straightforward.  There are four steps:

i. Configure the library.  This is usually as simple as running the
"./configure" script from within the root NGT package directory.

ii. Build the tools by running "make".

iii. Install the tools by running "make install".

While this simple sequence will suffice for most users, the configure
script has many options that you can use to adjust various properties,
such as compiler optimization flags or the search paths used to find
required libraries.  See the "INSTALL" file in this directory for more
detailed information.

C. Using the Library

When you install the library it will place files into three
subdirectories in the installation location.  The header files which
you will need to develop software using the library are located in the
"include/" subdirectory.  The compiled libraries, which you will need
to link your software against, are located in the "lib/" subdirectory.
You will need to configure your software development environment as
appropriate to locate these files.  Finally, a number of command-line
tools are provided in the "bin/" directory.  See the documentation for a
complete list of the tools.
