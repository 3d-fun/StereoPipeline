HOW TO MAKE A RELEASE

Here's a developer's checklist for performing a binary Ames Stereo
Pipeline (ASP) release.

1.) Modify the build system:

Inside ASP's configure.ac, remove "_post" and increment version number
on the AC_INIT line. Do not do this for VisionWorkbench, as that
library has its own versioning.

2.) Update ISIS Version in README (get it from the "version" file in
the ASP release tarball).

3.) Update NEWS

4.) Commit and tag release in repo. Example: 

  git tag v2.3.0 

Push the tags to the remote server with: 

 git push origin v2.3.0 # commit to your branch
 git push god    v2.3.0 # commit to main branch

If more commits were made and it is desired to apply this tag to a
different commit, first remove the exiting tag with:

  git tag -d v2.3.0
  git push origin :refs/tags/v2.3.0
  git push god    :refs/tags/v2.3.0

5.) Build and package the software and documentation:

  - Modify BinaryBuilder to deal with any changes in dependencies.
  - Build the dependenices, see BinaryBuilder/README, section 3.B, 
    part 1.
  - Build the documentation in StereoPipeline/docs/book. Must do
    make distclean at the top level first, to force that the ASP
    version gets updated.
  - Greatly reduce the size of the pdf with:
    gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook \
       -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=output.pdf asp_book.pdf
    (this only works with newer version of gs, such as on zula).
  - Copy the obtained pdf file to BinaryBuilder/dist-add/asp_book.pdf.
  - Build the ASP release tarball, see BinaryBuilder/README,
    section 3.B, part 2.

6.) Test all binary releases on different machines by running
    StereoPipelineTest.

7.) Check that the ASP version is correct in the documentation file.

NOTE: Steps 5 to 7 are done automatically by running on a Pleiades
machine the script

  $HOME/projects/BinaryBuilder/auto_build/launch_master.sh

The resulting release tarballs will go to BinaryBuilder/asp_tarballs,
and will need to unzipped and renamed to remove the timestamp from the
tarball name, and then zipped back.

8.) Copy the new builds to the release area at
/byss/docroot/stereopipeline/binaries and update the website, at
https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/cms/ (SG can give permissions to edit the
pages under /tech/asr/intelligent-robotics/ngt). 

9.) Send an announcement of the new release to the mailing list,
    at stereo-pipeline@lists.nasa.gov, listing the changes specified
    in NEWS.

10.) Modify the build system:

Inside ASP's configure.ac, append "_post" to version number in AC_INIT
line.

11.) Commit changes.
