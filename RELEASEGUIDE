HOW TO ROLL A RELEASE

Here's a developer checklist for performing a binary release

1.) Modify the build system:

Inside configure.ac, remove "_post" and increment version number from AC_INIT line.

2.) Update ISIS Version in README

3.) Update NEWS

4.) Commit and tag release in repo

5.) Download and operate BinaryBuilder on OSX10.6, x86_32, and x86_64

Code modification to Binary Builder will probably have to happen here as dependencies will have probably changed.

6.) Test all binary release on different machines by running StereoPipelineTest.

7.) Build docs, ensure you do 'make clean' first, to ensure that the
ASP version gets updated. To greatly reduce the file size use the command 

gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=output.pdf asp_book.pdf

8.) Check that the doc has the correct ASP version.

9.) Update website

10.) Modify the build system:

Inside configure.ac, append "_post" to version number in AC_INIT line.

11.) Commit changes.
