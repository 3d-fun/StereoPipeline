HOW TO ROLL A RELEASE

Here's a developer's checklist for performing a binary release.

1.) Modify the build system:

Inside ASP's configure.ac, remove "_post" and increment version number
from AC_INIT line. Do not do this for VW, as VW has its own
versioning.

2.) Update ISIS Version in README

3.) Update NEWS

4.) Commit and tag release in repo. Example: git tag v2.2.1

5.) Build and package the software and documentation:

  - Modify BinaryBuilder to deal with any changes in dependencies.
  - Build the dependenices, see BinaryBuilder/README, section 3.B, 
    part 1.
  - Build the documentation in StereoPipeline/docs/book. Must do
    make distclean at the top level first, to force that the ASP
    version gets updated.
  - Greatly reduce the size of the pdf with:
    gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook \
       -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=output.pdf asp_book.pdf
  - Put the doc in BinaryBuilder/asp_book.pdf.
  - Build the ASP release tarball, see BinaryBuilder/README,
    section 3.B, part 2.

7.) Test all binary releases on different machines by running
    StereoPipelineTest.

8.) Check that the documentation version is correct.

9.) Update the website.

10.) Modify the build system:

Inside ASP's configure.ac, append "_post" to version number in AC_INIT
line.

11.) Commit changes.
