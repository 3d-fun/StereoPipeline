HOW TO ROLL A RELEASE

Here's a developer checklist for performing a binary release

1.) Modify build system

Inside configure.ac, remove "_post" and increment version number from AC_INIT line.

2.) Update ISIS Version in README

3.) Update NEWS

Just summarize all commits that have happened since last release

4.) Commit and Tag release in repo

5.) Download and operate Lundy's binary builder on OSX10.6, x86_32, and x86_64

Code modification to Binary Builder will probably have to happen here as dependencies will have probably changed.

6.) Test all binary release on different machines by just running the example dataset

7.) Build docs

8.) Update website

9.) Modify build system

Inside configure.ac, append "_post" to version number in AC_INIT line.

10.) Commit changes.
